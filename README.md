# BioMutation
Proteins and nucleic acid mutations play a critical role in understanding mechanisms underlying diseases, evolutionary biology, and therapeutic targeting. Mutational studies provide insights into biomolecular structure, dynamics, and their interactions with macromolecules or small molecules. However, the scarcity of tools offering high-throughput mutation capabilities within user-friendly interfaces presents significant challenges in computational mutagenesis studies. We introduce BioMutation, a multifunctional graphical user-interface (GUI) designed to perform mutations in proteins, nucleic acids, or their complexes in a high-throughput and user-friendly manner. BioMutation employs Python-based scripts to execute i) user-defined mutations or all possible amino acid class-wise mutations in proteins or their complexes, or ii) introduce user-specific (in DNA/RNA) or all possible di-/tri-/tetrameric (in DNA) mutations in nucleic acids or their complexes. The platform enables users to create a comprehensive library of mutant structures in PDB,MOL2 and mmCIF  formats for further computational analysis, including molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, and binding affinity predictions. The applications of BioMutation webserver span multiple domains, including drug discovery, where it can be used to explore resistance mechanisms by modeling mutations in therapeutic targets. It is invaluable for designing optimized protein variants for industrial and therapeutic purposes, such as engineering enzymes or antibodies. Additionally, the tool can assist in studying nucleic acid-protein interactions, aptamer design, and investigating mutations implicated in genetic diseases.
